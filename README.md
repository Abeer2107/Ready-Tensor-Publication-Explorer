AAIDC Project 1: A RAG-based assistant that answers questions about Ready Tensor publications

## Overview

This project is the implementation of a RAG-based assistant designed to answer questions regarding some Ready Tensor publications stored in a dataset. Built with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and Google's [Gemini LLM](https://ai.google.dev/), it uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide concise, non-expert-friendly answers or summaries. 

## Project Structure

The directory structure of the project:

- `data/`: 
  - `publications.json`: dataset of some publications. Example:
```json
  [
      {
          "id": "pub1",
          "username": "author1",
          "license": "none"
          "title": "Sample Publication",
          "publication_description": "Content...",
      }
  ]
```
- `src/`:
  - `document_loader.py`: Processes and cleans the publications data, and builds a Chroma vector store.
  - `rag_pipeline.py`: Implements the RAG pipeline for querying.
  - `prompt.txt`: Defines the RAG prompt template
  - `cli.py`: CLI script for querying publications via terminal. [Debugging]
  - `ui.py`: GUI (Tkinter) script for browsing and querying publications. 
- `README.md`: You are here! üè≥
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `run.py`: Entry point (run `cli.py` or `ui.py`).
